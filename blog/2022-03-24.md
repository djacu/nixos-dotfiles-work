# ZFS Continued

## Partition Layout

Continuing looking at ZFS from the last time. Today, I'm looking at partition and dataset layout. The
[OpenZFS docs](https://openzfs.github.io/openzfs-docs/Getting%20Started/NixOS/index.html)
has tables for each of these layouts. I will reproduce them here with some explanation.

|         Name        | legacy boot |          ESP          | boot pool |            swap            |             root pool            |
|:-------------------:|:-----------:|:---------------------:|:---------:|:--------------------------:|:--------------------------------:|
| Partition type      | EF02        | EF00                  | BE00      | 8200                       | BF00                             |
| File system         |             | vfat                  | ZFS       | swap                       | ZFS                              |
| Size                | 1M          | 2G                    | 4G        | RAM size or user specified | Remaining disk or user specified |
| Optional encryption |             | Secure Boot           |           | plain dm-crypt             | ZFS native encryption            |
| Partition #         | 5           | 1                     | 2         | 4                          | 3                                |
| Mount point         |             | /boot/efis/disk-part1 | /boot     |                            | /                                |

The partitions are listed by block order on the storage device. The partition number is the value used for the `partnum` value when creating a new partition with `sgdisk -n`. There doesn't seem to be any reason for doing the partition numbering out of order but the guide has it this way and changing it would leave room for mistakes. Let's review each of the partitions and talk about why they are setup as such.

* legacy boot - The [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Install_Arch_Linux_on_ZFS#Partition_the_destination_drive) mentions that GRUB on BIOS/GPT configurations require a small (1~2 MiB) BIOS boot partition to embed its image of boot code. The `sgdisk` manual lists `EF02` as 'BIOS boot partition' so that makes sense.
* ESP - The parameters look pretty standard; the size does look larger than normal. When we look at the dataset layout later, it appears that the authors were leaving room for other distributions to be installed. So, a larger than normal ESP partition makes sense. We'll look at possibly doing secure boot later (Note: I could be totally wrong on this.). The mount point is not a literal path but more descriptive. More details when we get into scripting.
* boot pool - The previously linked article from the Arch Wiki also mentions, "ZFS manages its own partitions, so only a basic partition table scheme is required." So we can use `BE00`, Solaris Boot, for the boot partition. The size is larger than I've seen; possibly for the same reasons as the ESP partition.
* swap - Everything looks pretty standard here. Partition type `8200` is a "Linux Swap" partition. We will look at encryption as it comes up later.
* root pool - Similar to the boot pool, we will use `BF00`, Solaris Root, for the root partition. Again, we will look at encryption later.

## Dataset Layout

The dataset layout has been reproduced but with each row in hierarchical order.

Datasets with `canmount=off` and `mountpoint=none` are used as containers and no data is stored under such datasets. However, child datasets can inherit their properties or imitate directory structures. It is strange that `bpool` and `rpool` have `mountpoint` set. I have added that to the list of open questions. The scripts don't explicitly set the mount points for certain child datasets but I think there is a hint in this table that `mountpoint` is inherited. More explicitly, since `rpool/sys/DATA/default` is mounted at `/`, then child datasets with `canmount=on` will inherit that parent `mountpoint`. For example, `rpool/sys/DATA/default/home` is created without an explicit `mountpoint` and therefore defaults to `/home`.

There are additional datasets added in the scripts in the following pages in the OpenZFS documentation, but this is a minimal table that would be common to most setups.

I've recreated the table below in a format similar to the output you would see from `tree` along with the mount points for each non-empty container. Some of datasets are not called out in the table but are in the scripts in the following pages in the OpenZFS documentation.

```

        └── default             -> /boot

    └── DATA

        │   ├── home            -> /home

        │   ├── srv             -> /srv
