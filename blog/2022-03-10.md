# ZFS Continued

Today we will look at some guides on
the [NixOS Wiki](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/ZFS),
the [OpenZFS docs](https://openzfs.github.io/openzfs-docs/Getting%20Started/NixOS/index.html),
[Elis Hirwing's blog](https://elis.nu/blog/2019/08/encrypted-zfs-mirror-with-mirrored-boot-on-nixos/),
the [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/ZFS),
and [Programster's Blog](https://blog.programster.org/zfs-cheatsheet).

## Partitioning

Partitioning seems straight forward for a single disk. The NixOS Wiki uses `parted` which I have used previously. First a new disk label must be created and `gpt` is used. More information on why can be seen on the Arch Wiki [Partitioning](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Partitioning#GUID_Partition_Table) page. From there the standard boot and swap partitions are created as well as a partition using the rest of the disk that will hold our filesystem.

## Filesystem Hierarchy Layout

Now we are getting into ZFS pool and dataset creation. The NixOS Wiki and OpenZFS docs have configurations for the boot and root pools using `zpool`. Let us list out all the optional arguments so we can see what they are, what they mean, and why they are specified as such. The description of the options can be found on the OpenZFS docs
[Miscellaneous](https://openzfs.github.io/openzfs-docs/man/7/index.html) page under
[zpoolprops](https://openzfs.github.io/openzfs-docs/man/7/zpoolprops.7.html),
[vdevprops](https://openzfs.github.io/openzfs-docs/man/7/vdevprops.7.html),
and
[zfsprops](https://openzfs.github.io/openzfs-docs/man/7/zfsprops.7.html#).

* `ashift`: As we saw before, this specifies the pool minimum sector size as a power of two. Both guides set this to 12, but for the sake of future-proofing I'll be using 13, which is 8 KiB. There are some NVMe drives out there with 16 KiB sector sizes, but they seem rare.
* `autotrim`: Turns on/off TRIM; must have for SSD devices. I'll be leaving this on.
* `acltype`: Controls whether ACLs are enabled and if so what type of ACL to use. This [reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/zfs/comments/dltik7/whats_the_purpose_of_the_acltype_property/), this [post](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/linux-access-control-lists) on Redhat's site, and, of course, the [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Access_Control_Lists) give some background on ACL and why we want it set to `posix` or `posixacl` (alias for `posix`). Basically, it allows for additional, more flexible permission mechanisms for file systems. There is a note in the OpenZFS docs encouraging us to set the `xattr` property to `sa` (i.e. `xattr=sa`) and to see the `xattr` entry for more details. The previously mentioned Reddit thread touches on this a bit as well.
* `canmount`: This property determines whether the file system can be mounted or not. Both configurations have this set to `off` for the `zpool`. I imagine that is because we will be creating `datasets` that will be explicitly mounted to mount points in our file system later.
* `compatibility`: Only the OpenZFS configuration creates a separate boot pool and specifies this property as `grub2`. If I am reading the documentation in zpoolprops correctly, leaving it unset (the same as `off` and means compatibility is disabled) allows the root pool to use any/all features. All the different compatibility files can been found [here](https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/tree/master/cmd/zpool/compatibility.d).
* `compression`: [There](https://www.reddit.com/r/zfs/comments/mdph5g/openzfs_203_and_zstd_vs_openzfs_086_and_lz4/) [is a](https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/pull/9735) [lot of](https://www.reddit.com/r/zfs/comments/orzpuy/zstd_vs_lz4_for_nvme_ssds/) [data](https://indico.fnal.gov/event/16264/contributions/36466/attachments/22610/28037/Zstd__LZ4.pdf) and [discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23210491) on `lz4` versus `zstd`. `lz4` was the defacto compression option for years but `zstd` was introduced into ZFS in 2019 (both were authored by the same person, [Yann Collet](https://github.com/Cyan4973)). `zstd` seems to be the way forward and both configurations use this. Just noticed that the OpenZFS docs use `lz4` for the boot pool. Not going to argue.
* `devices`: The boot pool has this set to `off`. According to the OpenZFS docs, this controls whether device nodes can be opened on this file system. I guess that means you cannot open `vdev` nodes... whatever that means.
* `dnodesize`: I found [some](https://openzfs.org/wiki/Documentation/DnodeSync) [information](https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/solaris/ZFSBroadDiskStructure) on dnodes but I still am confused. Both configurations have this property set to `auto` and the OpenZFS docs recommend the same when `xattr=sa` so we will go with that.
* `encryption`: Both configurations and the current default is `aes-256-gcm` so we will go with that.
* `keylocation`: We will set this to `prompt` so that ZFS will query us for a key when decrypting the pool. We can change this to read from a file in the future if we so choose.
* `keyformat`: We will set this to `passphrase` so we can use a simple text passphrase.
* `mountpoint`: Specifies the point mount point for this pool on the file system. The root pool is mounted to `/` and the boot pool is mounted to `/boot`, which makes sense.
* `normalization`: Both configurations have this property set to `formD`, I tried searching for [additional](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E78901_01/html/E78912/gpssl.html) [information](https://www.truenas.com/community/threads/modern-guidance-on-zfs-casesensitivity-normalization-and-utf8only-properties.73636/post-511838) about the other available values but still do not understand the difference. Examples would be helpful. There is an [old blog post](https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/linux/ForcedUTF8Filenames) discussing why requiring UTF-8 filenames is a bad idea but I'm going to roll with the recommendations given. Setting this property also implies `utf8only=on`, so only UTF-8 filenames will be allowed.
* `recordsize`: Both configurations leave this property unset so it defaults to 128 KiB. There are several blog posts linked in the OpenZFS docs about tuning this property, but I think it's best to leave it be as 128 KiB is a good middle ground. However, I will set it explicitly.
* `relatime`: Both configurations set this property to `on`. This is a good compromise between having `atime` on or off. Redhat has a [page](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/6/html/power_management_guide/relatime) with further information.
* `xattr`: Both the configurations set this property to `sa` and the documentation *strongly* encourages this value. Good enough for me. Setting this to `off` seems like a bad idea and setting it to `on` sets no practical limit on the size or number of attributes which can be set on a file. `sa` allows up to 64 KiB of data to be stored per-file in space reserved for system attributes, and if more is required, it will automatically be written as a directory-based xattr.
* `-R`: Both configurations set this as `/mnt` which, I believe, is standard practice when configuring a file system before bootstrap. This feels reminiscent of my previous experience bootstrapping Arch and NixOS before.

Phew. That is a lot of information to digest. Let's mock up the commands we would use for a boot pool and root pool similar to what is on the Wikis. Take note that pool properties are set with the `-o` flag and file system properties are set with the `-O` flag.... WHY!?

```shell
zpool create \
    -o compatibility=grub2 \
    -o ashift=13 \
    -o autotrim=on \
    -O acltype=posixacl \
    -O canmount=off \
    -O compression=lz4 \
    -O devices=off \
    -O normalization=formD \
    -O relatime=on \
    -O xattr=sa \
    -O mountpoint=/boot \
    -R /mnt \
    <boot-pool>
    <boot-partition>
```

```shell
zpool create \
    -o ashift=13 \
    -o autotrim=on \
    -O acltype=posixacl \
    -O canmount=off \
    -O compression=zstd \
    -O dnodesize=auto \
    -O encryption=aes-256-gcm \
    -O keylocation=prompt \
    -O keyformat=passphrase \
    -O normalization=formD \
    -O relatime=on \
    -O xattr=sa \
    -O mountpoint=/ \
    -R /mnt \
    <root-pool>
    <root-partition>
```
